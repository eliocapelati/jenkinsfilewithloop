= Running Jenkinsfile with external configuration


== Short description

This repo contains a Jenkinsfile with a external configuration file.

This is very usefull to maintaing just only one Jenkinksfile structure, and define all the pipeline metadata into a external file.

We use a json file in order to make external configuration flexible.



=== Necessary plugins

To make the things easy, we're using  the https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-utility-steps/[Pipeline Utility Steps] to easily load the config from external.

Please, make shure to install this plugin into your Jenkins Server.
